# LIRI-Bot
This is a backend script that will retrieve movie, music, and find nearby concerts for artists you search for.

The LIRI-Bot uses Javascript, Node.js, the OMDB API, the node-Spotify-API, the Bands in Town API, Axios, FS, and moment.js

This application is divided into three main functions: Concert-Search using the Bands in Town API; Movie-Search using the OMDB API; and Spotify-Search using the node-Spotify-API to search for tracks.

————————————————————————————————————————————————

To properly run the application start by typing:

node liri.js 

followed by any of the following:

• movie-this
• concert-this
• spotify-this-song
• do-what-it-says (this reads the "random.txt" file to search for whatever is contained in it)

followed by whatever you are searching for (Movie title, song track, or a music artist).
